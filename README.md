# InfixToPostfixEvaluator
<b>Objective</b>
<br>
The objective of the project was to write an infix expression parser using the stack data structure. The solution was to parse an infix expression given in string format and then efficiently evaluate it, printing the evaluated result to the console.

<b>System Functionality Overview</b>
<br>
Our team developed a system that first prints a title heading containing a short description of the program. Next, the system reads in each infix expression from the input file.  It then parses the expression given in string format and converts the formatted expression to a postfix expression. Next, the postfix expression is evaluated. Finally, the evaluated result is printed to the console. This process is repeated until all expressions contained within the input file have been evaluated. The system is flexible and gracefully handles all invalid expressions.
 If any of the input expressions are determined to be invalid, the printed result for that expression will be a message stating the expression was invalid. Also, if the infix expression contains an arithmetic error such as divide-by-zero or modulus-by-zero, an error message will be printed to the console informing the user of the arithmetic error.
